## Overview
The Resume Parser NER is a project designed to parse resumes and extract relevant information using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. The project utilizes the Spacy library for entity recognition and the FitZ library for reading PDF files.

## Key Features
* üìÑ **Resume Parsing**: Extract text from PDF resumes
* üìä **Entity Recognition**: Identify and extract entities such as names, locations, and organizations
* üíº **Skill Matching**: Match skills extracted from resumes with predefined skill sets

## Technology Stack
* Backend: Python
* ML: Spacy
* Libs: FitZ, Streamlit
* Database: None

## Getting Started
To get started with the project, follow these steps:
1. Clone the repository using `git clone https://github.com/JananiSoundararajan/resume-parser-ner.git`
2. Install the required libraries using `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Run the application using `python app.py` or `streamlit run app.py`
